# LD_LinearLeastSquareFit
A simple command line calculator to find the linear regression between data points.
The user is first asked if they wish to calculate anything in case they entered the program by accident.
The user is then prompted to enter how many data points they have (this must be a valid input).
Data is retrieved from the user in the form of x coordinates first, then y coordinates.
Data is not validated yet. This will be fixed in the future.
I used a class for the calculations because it's more easily organized and reusable.
I also used dynamic memory allocation instead of vectors so as not to deal with resizing.
This program has been tested in Visual Studio 2017 and found functional.
